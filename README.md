I've stareded coding becouse i would like to change my job, but in the same time I get same extra work so coding were for me just a mind exercise. My experience in programing is teaching me how to think it helped me in my actual work. In the near future I'm planning to go in for programming course (backend) in static typing language like C++ or Java.
